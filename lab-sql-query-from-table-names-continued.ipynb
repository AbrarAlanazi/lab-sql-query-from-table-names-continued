    "## Report: Enhanced SQL Generation with GPT-3.5-Turbo via Few-Shot Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective: To assess the efficacy of few-shot learning within prompts to improve GPT-3.5-turbo's ability to generate accurate SQL queries from natural language inputs, focusing on complex scenarios and varying query types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology: Four distinct scenarios were constructed, each involving employee and salary data with varying degrees of complexity. Each scenario included CREATE TABLE statements with data insertion examples, followed by a sample query demonstrating the desired SQL output. Natural language user queries were then passed to GPT-3.5-turbo to generate corresponding SQL code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Consistent and Accurate SQL Generation:\n",
    "GPT-3.5-turbo demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in generating SQL queries across all scenarios.\n",
    "The model effectively handled complex queries involving joins, aggregations (AVG), date filtering, and subqueries.\n",
    "The inclusion of CREATE TABLE statements with sample data significantly improved the model's understanding of data structures and relationships.\n",
    "Contextual Understanding and Logical Reasoning:\n",
    "The model displayed a strong contextual understanding, accurately translating natural language queries into logically sound SQL code.\n",
    "It correctly interpreted the intent behind complex queries, such as those requiring the identification of employees with salaries above their department's average.\n",
    "Effective Few-Shot Learning:\n",
    "The provision of sample queries within the prompts proved highly effective in guiding the model's output.\n",
    "The model consistently adhered to the formatting and logical patterns demonstrated in the sample queries.\n",
    "Minimal Variations and No Hallucinations:\n",
    "The generated SQL queries exhibited minimal variations, indicating a high level of consistency.\n",
    "There were no instances of the model hallucinating table or column names, or producing syntactically incorrect SQL code.\n",
    "The model did well in the complex subquery example.\n",
    "Variations and Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "While the model performed exceptionally well, its accuracy remains dependent on the clarity and precision of the prompts.\n",
    "If the provided sample query is incorrect, the model will follow that incorrect pattern.\n",
    "The model's ability to handle highly complex or ambiguous queries may be limited.\n",
    "What I Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Power of Few-Shot Learning:\n",
    "Providing a few examples within the prompt significantly enhances the model's ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant SQL code.\n",
    "This technique allows for more effective control over the model's output and reduces the likelihood of errors.\n",
    "Importance of Detailed Schema and Data Examples:\n",
    "Including CREATE TABLE statements with data insertion examples is crucial for providing the model with a clear understanding of the database structure.\n",
    "This approach minimizes ambiguity and improves the accuracy of the generated SQL queries.\n",
    "Potential for SQL Automation:\n",
    "Language models like GPT-3.5-turbo have the potential to automate the generation of SQL queries, streamlining database interactions and reducing development time.\n",
    "Prompt Engineering is Critical:\n",
    "The way the prompt is created, and the data provided, is the most important factor in the success of the model.\n"
